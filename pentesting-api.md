# REST API

## General approach

1. Try to find all possible endpoints
2. Try to find all possible urls
3. For all url try to find all possible params
4. Don't forget about parameter pollution
5. Try wildcard params also
6. For all request url try to change HTTP request method
7. For all request try to change content-type
8. When you provide data to API you decide what type you insert, try different then standard
9. Always play with URL
10. Try to identify avaiable API versions
11. Use cool tools :) (Burp, AutoRepeater, Arjun, FFUF, kiterunner, unfurl, logger++ ... etc ...)
